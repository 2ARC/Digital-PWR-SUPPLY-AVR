Hardware was designed with Proteus 8 and software with Atmel Studio 7.0

This is an old project build on four hands, me and a intern at our company that has the skill of DIY PCB boards. If you
know what copper clad laminate and etching solution, household clothes iron and laser printer can do together, so sure,
you know what I am talking about.

Almost all parts came from a waste bucket except for the mcu and some conections pins. Case came from an APS nobreak,
toroidal transformer from a thermal printer, LCD from a dispatch indicator etc.
